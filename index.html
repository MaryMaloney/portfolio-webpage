    <h2> About Mary</h2>
    <p>My career in fashion merchandising has led me to a startup where I have had the to opportunity to collaborate with web developers on website redesign. I have found through working with various teams, that I am more interested in what makes our website function than the product it was designed for.  </p>

    <p>I am excited to have began the journey to becoming a software developer. Pursuing this career will give me the opportunity to continuously develop my technical skills while still having the freedom to be creative.</p>
